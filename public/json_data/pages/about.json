Currently, this information is gathered from hippocampome.org (other external resources will be integrated as further data are made available) and displayed on appropriately designed panels where, for both the pre and postsynaptic neurons of a given connection, relevant information are shown (e.g., cell name, hippocampal region and layer, original paper where the connection is referred to). The user can either display all the available connections listed on the entry page or a subset of them through a dedicated filter panel where Regions and Layers of interest can be selected, for both pre and postsynaptic neurons. For each connection, the link to the source web page is provided.\nThe Morphologies page shows hippocampal neuron reconstructed morphologies fetched from the neuromorpho.org portal. For each morphology, a dedicated panel is provided containing relevant information (e.g., morphology name, cell species, cell region, physical integrity of the morphology) and a set of interactive links. These allow to: 1) download the morphology file (in .asc format) or select it for batch download; 2) open the file source web page; 3) select the morphology for further processing (see below, section Integration with the Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Builder); 4) zoom in and out a 2D image and 5) show an interactive 3D representation of the morphology.  The users can select the data of interest through the filter panel (filter keys are: Species, Region and Cell Type).\nSimilarly to the Connections page, the Electrophysiology page displays information and links relative to the hippocampal cell electrophysiology. Data can be filtered by Region and Layers and a link to the source page is provided. Currently, the unique external referenced resource is hippocampome.org. \n"

In order to achieve this goal, we have integrated the resources available on the HFH with the EBRAINS Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Builder. On the HFH, the users can browse both the Morphologies and Models pages and select the .mod files of interest and a specific morphology file, through dedicated checkboxes and select buttons respectively. While the selection is being made, the Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Builder panel is populated with the chosen item names, so as to allow the user to check the files being used for the model construction, at any time. Once the selection is completed, by clicking on the Send to HH Neuron Builder button, the users are redirected to the HH Neuron Builder workflow page through which they can complete the model building, launch the model optimization on an HPC system and finally fetch and run the optimized model."
