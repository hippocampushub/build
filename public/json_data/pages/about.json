New data will be continuously integrated as further resources are made available. For both the pre and postsynaptic neurons of a given connection, relevant information are shown (e.g., cell name, hippocampal region and layer, original paper where the connection is referred to). The user can either display all the available connections listed on the entry page or a subset of them through a dedicated filter panel where Regions and Layers of interest can be selected, for both pre and postsynaptic neurons. For each connection, the link to the source web page is provided.<br>The <strong>Morphologies</strong> page shows hippocampal neuron reconstructed morphologies. For each morphology, a dedicated panel is provided containing relevant information (e.g., morphology name, cell species, cell region, physical integrity of the morphology) and a set of interactive links. These allow to: 1) download the morphology file (in .asc format) or select it for batch download; 2) open the file source web page; 3) select the morphology for further processing (see below, section Integration with the Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Builder); 4) zoom in and out a 2D image and 5) show an interactive 3D representation of the morphology.  The users can select the data of interest through the filter panel (filter keys are: Species, Region and Cell Type).<br>Similarly to the Connections page, the <strong>Electrophysiology</strong> page displays information and links relative to the hippocampal cell electrophysiology. Data can be filtered by Region and Layers and a link to the source page is provided."

At any time the user is allowed to check files being used for the model construction, at any time.<br>Once the selection is completed, by clicking on the <i>Launch HH Neuron Builder</i> button, the users are redirected to the HH Neuron Builder workflow page through which they can complete the model building, launch the model optimization on an HPC system and finally fetch and use the optimized model."
